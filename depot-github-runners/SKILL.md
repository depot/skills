  using Depot Cache with GitHub Actions, or running Dagger/Dependabot on Depot runners.
  Also use when the user mentions depot-ubuntu, depot-windows, depot-macos runner labels,

# Depot GitHub Actions Runners

Depot provides managed, ephemeral, single-tenant GitHub Actions runners. Drop-in replacement for GitHub-hosted runners — change the `runs-on` label and everything else stays the same.

**Requirement:** Repository must be owned by a GitHub organization (not a personal account).

## Setup

1. Depot dashboard → GitHub Actions → Connect to GitHub → Install Depot GitHub App
2. For public repos: GitHub org settings → Actions → Runner groups → Default → "Allow public repositories"
3. Update `runs-on` in your workflow files

## Runner Labels

Use a single label. Format: `depot-{os}-{version}[-{arch}][-{size}]`

### Ubuntu (Intel x86 — AMD EPYC)

| Label | CPUs | RAM | Disk | $/min |
|-------|------|-----|------|-------|
| `depot-ubuntu-24.04` | 2 | 8 GB | 100 GB | $0.004 |
| `depot-ubuntu-24.04-4` | 4 | 16 GB | 130 GB | $0.008 |
| `depot-ubuntu-24.04-8` | 8 | 32 GB | 150 GB | $0.016 |
| `depot-ubuntu-24.04-16` | 16 | 64 GB | 180 GB | $0.032 |
| `depot-ubuntu-24.04-32` | 32 | 128 GB | 200 GB | $0.064 |
| `depot-ubuntu-24.04-64` | 64 | 256 GB | 250 GB | $0.128 |

Ubuntu 22.04 also available: `depot-ubuntu-22.04`, `depot-ubuntu-22.04-4`, etc.

### Ubuntu (ARM — Graviton4)

Same sizes and pricing as Intel. Add `-arm` suffix:
`depot-ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `depot-ubuntu-24.04-arm-4`, `depot-ubuntu-24.04-arm-8`, etc.

### Windows Server

| Label | CPUs | RAM | $/min |
|-------|------|-----|-------|
| `depot-windows-2025` | 2 | 8 GB | $0.008 |
| `depot-windows-2025-4` | 4 | 16 GB | $0.016 |
| `depot-windows-2025-8` through `-64` | 8–64 | 32–256 GB | $0.032–$0.256 |

Windows Server 2022 also available: `depot-windows-2022`, etc.
**Windows limitation:** No Hyper-V. Docker does not work on Windows runners.

### macOS (Apple M2)

| Label | CPUs | RAM | $/min |
|-------|------|-----|-------|
| `depot-macos-15` / `depot-macos-latest` | 8 | 24 GB | $0.08 |
| `depot-macos-14` | 8 | 24 GB | $0.08 |

macOS is NOT fully elastic — fixed pool with FIFO queuing. Startup plan+ only.

### Aliases

`depot-ubuntu-latest` → Ubuntu 24.04, `depot-windows-latest` → Windows 2025, `depot-macos-latest` → macOS 15

## Migration Example

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    # Before:
    # runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # After:
    runs-on: depot-ubuntu-24.04-4
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

## Common Mistakes

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG — multiple labels cause stability issues
runs-on: [self-hosted, depot-ubuntu-24.04]

# ✅ CORRECT — always use a single Depot runner label
runs-on: depot-ubuntu-24.04-4
```

## Caching

Actions using the GitHub Actions cache API automatically use **Depot Cache** — no config changes needed. This includes `actions/cache`, `actions/setup-node`, `actions/setup-python`, `actions/setup-java`, and any action using `@actions/cache`.

**Pre-configured build tool caches** (zero config on Depot runners):

|Tool     |What's pre-configured                                         |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|Turborepo|`TURBO_API` env var set — just run `turbo build`              |
|Bazel    |`~/.bazelrc` pre-populated — just run `bazel build //...`     |
|sccache  |`SCCACHE_WEBDAV_ENDPOINT` set — use `RUSTC_WRAPPER: 'sccache'`|
|Maven    |`settings.xml` pre-populated (cache id `depot-cache`)         |
|Pants    |`pants.toml` pre-configured — just run `pants package ::`     |
|moonrepo |Env vars set — just run `moon run build`                      |

Cache behavior: repository-scoped, no branch isolation, encrypted, up to 1000 MiB/s throughput, configurable retention (7/14/30 days).

To disable auto-cache: org settings → turn off "Allow Actions jobs to automatically connect to Depot Cache."

## Dagger Integration

```yaml
runs-on: depot-ubuntu-latest,dagger=0.15.1
```

Launches a dedicated Dagger Engine VM with persistent NVMe cache. Dagger CLI pre-installed. Additional $0.04/min.

## Egress Filtering (Linux Only)

Configure in org settings → GitHub Actions Runners → Egress Rules. Set default rule to Allow or Deny, then add specific allow/deny rules for IPs, CIDRs, or hostnames. Not supported on macOS or Windows. Incompatible with Tailscale.

## Dependabot

Enable "Dependabot on self-hosted runners" in GitHub org settings. Jobs auto-run on `depot-ubuntu-latest`.

**Important:** OIDC is not supported for Dependabot. Use `token:` input with a `DEPOT_TOKEN` secret instead.

## SSH Debugging

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
  - run: npm test
```

## Troubleshooting

|Error                                       |Fix                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|"No space left on device"                   |OS uses ~70 GB disk; upgrade to larger runner or clean disk in workflow                            |
|"Lost communication with server"            |Check status.depot.dev; check org usage caps                                                       |
|"Operation was canceled"                    |Manual cancel, concurrency cancel-in-progress, or OOM — check memory in dashboard                  |
|"Unable to get ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL"|Dependabot doesn't support OIDC — use `DEPOT_TOKEN` secret                                         |
|Workflows not starting                      |Verify single runner label; check runner group allows the repo; verify Depot GitHub App permissions|
|Stuck workflows                             |Force cancel via GitHub API: `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{id}/force-cancel`           |
